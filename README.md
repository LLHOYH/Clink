# CLINK

Welcome to Clink!
Clink is a LST that generates cash rewards when you spend crypto.

Do you know how credit card rewards are generated? 
### Do you know that some of the rewards are actually indirectly paid by the less wealthy and less educated consumers? 
Traditional credit card rewards has a tricky part, as the less affluent consumers has less access to credit cards. Even though they are paying for the same expenses, they are not enjoying the rewards like the more wealthy people do. Even if they are educated and want to apply for a credit card, they probably won't pass the Credit Score Check and Income Check. 

## Clink is here to solve this issue. 
By utilizing the LST mechanism on Solana, Clink allows everyone to enjoy payment rewards with no background check and no unfair treatment. Just like other LSTs, Clink's price increase as a form of rewarding holders with yield. But also unlike other LSTs, Clink has a staking pool that gives additional awards to consumers who spend onchain with their most prefer crypto payment app.
