# CLINK

Welcome to Clink!
Clink is a LST that generates cash rewards when you spend crypto.

Do you know how credit card rewards are generated? 
### Do you know that some of the rewards are indirectly paid by the less wealthy and less educated consumers? 
Traditional credit card rewards is tricky, it opens up more privilege and more premium rewards to those who are already more wealthy. The less affluent consumers have less access to credit cards. Even though they are paying for the same expenses, they are not enjoying the rewards like the more wealthy consumers do. Even if some of them are aware of the benefit of credit card, it doesn't mean they are able to get one. They probably won't pass the Credit Score Check and Income Check conducted by the bank. 

## Clink is here to solve this issue. 
By utilizing the LST mechanism on Solana, Clink allows everyone to enjoy payment rewards with no background check and no unfair treatment. You get amount of rewards with a direct proportion to your spending amount. Just like other LSTs, Clink's price increase as a form of rewarding holders with yield. But also unlike other LSTs, Clink has a staking pool that gives additional awards to consumers who spend onchain with their most prefer crypto payment app.
